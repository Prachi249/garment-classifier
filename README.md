# Deep CNN Garment Classifier ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘—

This project uses a Deep Convolutional Neural Network built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of garments (e.g., shirts, dresses, pants). Itâ€™s part of a larger outfit suggestion tool.

## Features
- Cleans and filters non-image files
- Uses OpenCV for image reading
- Prepares data for model training

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```
    python idk.py
    ```

## Future Plans
- Add CNN training and evaluation
- Integrate classifier with outfit picker app
